# Wofpack_Parking_System

We aim to design a Wolf Parking Management System to create an organized and efficient method to manage parking lots, zones, spaces, and users (students, employees, and visitors) within a campus setting. It encompasses tasks like Information Processing (managing basic information about drivers, parking lots, and permits), Maintaining permits and vehicle information(assigning permits, recording and updating permit information), Generating and maintaining citations(tracking citations for parking violations), and generating reports.
